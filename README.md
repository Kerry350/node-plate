node-plate
==========

Boilerplate. For Node.js projects.

I start a fair few Node.js projects, and the boilerplate stage is always annoying. Don't get me wrong, tools like Yeoman, npm, Bower, Grunt et al alleviate a lot of this. But this boilerplate was more for quite specific things I use over and over - like Passport.js method set up, or reuseable components like image uploading. It's probably not something others will find that useful, as it's more set up for me to use on new projects, but you never know.
